        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am Jack, and I like to make stuff. I have been making things as long as I can remember. Through many different projects.
          I have learned how to use CAD to make 3d models and PCB's.
          I learned to program in Python, HTML, Java, JavaScript, C, C++. 
        </p>

        <p>I like to do a lot of sports, although my main sport is Mountain Biking I also do Snowboarding, Skimboarding, Surfing, Cross Country Running, and Backpacking.</p>

        <h2>CAD</h2>
        
        
        <p>
          For the CAD unit we made a Skateboard in onshape.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Deck</h2>
        
        <p>
          I started out by making a fully constrained sketch using the center rectangle and circle tools. Then I extruded my sketch, put bolt holes in the board to mount the trucks and filleted the boards edge.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Trucks</h2>

        <p> Making the trucks was very interesting to me because we made parts in the air before connecting them. 
          One thing I learned is that you can use a sketch after you made it by using the use tool, this is very helpful because you don't need to remake constraints that you made before. I also helped Yannick with an issue where his sketch got constrained wrong because of one miss click and he got stuck.  </p>
      
        <h2>Wheels and Bearings</h2>

        <p>The wheels and bearings were pretty simple, I revolved a sketch for the polyurethane part of the wheel and then made a bearing inside of the wheel using some of the dimensions with the use tool.</p>
      
        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>I added bearings to both sides of the wheel then used a cool tool to combine everything. Its called replicate and it helps with repetitve assembly so thaat you dont have to go through all of the assembly steps every time.</p>
