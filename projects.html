          <h2>Electronic Dropper</h2>
          <p>
            I designed a mount, PCB and software for an electronic dropper post conversion for my Fox Transfer SL

          <h2>Light Sculpture</h2>
          
          
          <p>
            For the CAD unit we made a Skateboard in onshape.
          </p>
          
          <h2>The Deck</h2>
          
          <p>
            I started out by making a fully constrained sketch using the center rectangle and circle tools. Then I extruded my sketch, put bolt holes in the board to mount the trucks and filleted the boards edge. At first I thought I needed to make circles in the sketch to extrude holdes but onshape has a specific hole tool that makes tolerances easy to set.
          </p>
          
          <h2>The Trucks</h2>
  
          <p> Making the trucks was very interesting to me because we made parts in the air before connecting them. 
            One thing I learned is that you can use a sketch after you made it by using the use tool, this is very helpful because you don't need to remake constraints that you made before. I also helped Yannick with an issue where his sketch got constrained wrong because of one miss click and he got stuck.  </p>
        
          <h2>Wheels and Bearings</h2>
  
          <p>The wheels and bearings were pretty simple, I revolved a sketch for the polyurethane part of the wheel and then made a bearing inside of the wheel using some of the dimensions with the use tool.</p>
        
          <h2>Assembly</h2>
  
          <p>I added bearings to both sides of the wheel then used a cool tool to combine everything. Its called replicate and it helps with repetitve assembly so that you dont have to go through all of the assembly steps every time.</p>
