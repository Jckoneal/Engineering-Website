        <h2>Series Circuit</h2>

        <p>
            We started by building simple circuits to get a better understanding of how electricity works, 
            like how voltage drop affects the flow.
             I put together a series circuit and learned that while I couldn’t measure the current (amps) directly across an LED due to its low resistance, 
             I could still figure out the current flowing through the whole circuit. 
             To do that, I used Ohm's law.
             By measuring the resistor in the circuit with a multimeter, I found the resistance and the voltage drop across it, 
             which allowed me to calculate the current. 
             Since the current stays the same throughout a series circuit, the current across the LED is the same as the resistor. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Parallel Circuit</h2>
        
        <p>
          For this project, I built a parallel circuit that had two branches, each consisting of a resistor and an LED in series. This setup helped me understand how current behaves in parallel circuits.
        </p>
        <p>
        In a parallel circuit, each branch has its own current path. To measure the current through each branch, I measured the resistance and voltage drop across each resistor. Using Ohm's law (again), I could determine the current through each resistor. Since each resistor was in series with an LED, this also gave me the current flowing through the respective LED.
        </p>
        <p>
        The total current draw of the circuit is simply the sum of the currents from each of the parallel branches. By understanding the current flow through each component, I was able to see how the total current in a parallel circuit is distributed across the different paths.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Night Light Circuit</h2>

        <p> 
            The nightlight circuit uses a photoresistor and a 3906 PNP transistor to control an LED based on ambient light levels. The circuit is powered by a 9V supply, with the positive terminal connected to one side of the photoresistor. The photoresistor changes resistance depending on the amount of light: low resistance in bright light and high resistance in darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
            The photoresistor is connected to the collector of the 3906 transistor, which acts as a switch. The base of the transistor is connected through a 100kΩ resistor, which controls the base current. The emitter of the transistor is connected to the LED circuit, which includes a 100Ω current-limiting resistor connected to ground. The resistor makes sure that the led doesn’t draw too much current and explode. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When the light level is low, the increased resistance of the photoresistor allows enough current to reach the base of the transistor, turning it on. Once on, current flows from the collector to the emitter, lighting up the LED. When the photoresistor detects enough light, its resistance drops, reducing the base current and turning the transistor off, which keeps the LED off.
        </p>
        <p>
            The color-coded voltage levels in the wiring diagram illustrate how the voltage changes across the circuit under different lighting conditions, demonstrating how the transistor controls the LED.
        </p>
        <h2>LED Flasher Circuit</h2>

        <p>
            I built an LED flasher circuit using a 555 timer IC to create a continuous on-off cycle for the LED. The timer switches between high and low output, controlling when the LED flashes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The LED flasher circuit works by using the 555 timer in a mode where it continuously switches on and off. The timer sends a high signal to turn the LED on and a low signal to turn it off. This on-off cycle repeats at a rate determined by the resistors and capacitor in the circuit. When the timer’s output goes high, the LED lights up, and when the output goes low, the LED turns off. This creates the flashing effect, with the timing controlled by how the capacitor charges and discharges through the resistors.
        </p>
        <p>
            More specifiaclly I used the 555 timer along with resistors and a capacitor to control the LED. The circuit is wired with the 555 timer in astable mode, meaning it continuously toggles between high and low output states. Pin 8 is connected to the positive supply voltage, while pin 1 is grounded. Pins 4 and 8 are also tied to the positive supply to reset the timer. A resistor is connected between pins 7 (discharge) and 8, and another resistor is placed between pins 7 and 6 (threshold), with a capacitor connected from pin 6 to ground to set the timing. Pin 3, the output, is connected to the LED, with the LED grounded through a resistor.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used an oscilloscope to measure the wave generated by the 555 timer circuit. One challenge I had is that I couldn't get the potentiometers that we had in class to work with the circuit so I used a normal resistor instead, this makes the circuit oscillate at a constant interval
        </p>
        <!-- <h2>Arduino</h2>

        <p>I added bearings to both sides of the wheel then used a cool tool to combine everything. Its called replicate and it helps with repetitve assembly so that you dont have to go through all of the assembly steps every time.</p>
